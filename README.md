# mathVis

**mathVis** is a Streamlit-powered educational app for exploring and visually understanding fundamental geometrical objects from linear and discrete optimization, such as convex hulls, polyhedra, and cones.  
The app gives **graphical representations, intuitive descriptions, and mathematical explanations** for each object.

---

## Features

- üî¢ Interactive selection of geometric objects: Convex Hull, Conical Hull, Convex Cone, Polytope, Polyhedral Cone, and more.
- üìä Visualization of each object using Matplotlib.
- üìò Clear descriptions and mathematical (LaTeX-formatted) explanations.
- ‚ö° Powered by Streamlit for instant web-based interactivity.
- üóÉÔ∏è Modular code: Easily add new objects as Python modules in the `graphs/` folder.

## Geometric Structures: Common Properties and Comparisons

All geometric structures in this app are **convex sets**, playing central roles in geometry and optimization. They differ mainly in their definitions (via points, rays, inequalities) and boundedness.

| Structure        | Convex? | Defined by                                  | Bounded?          | Generators                |
|------------------|---------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------|---------------------------|
| Convex Hull      | Yes     | Convex combinations of points               | Yes (if finite)   | Points (vertices)         |
| Conical Hull     | Yes     | Non-negative linear combinations of vectors | No (except at 0)  | Vectors (rays)            |
| Convex Cone      | Yes     | Non-negative linear combinations            | No (except at 0)  | Rays/generators           |
| Polyhedral Cone  | Yes     | Linear inequalities through 0 (the origin)  | No                | Vectors (rays, finite)    |
| Polyhedron       | Yes     | Linear inequalities                         | Can be; not always| Faces, edges, vertices    |
| Polytope         | Yes     | Linear inequalities (and bounded) or convex hull | Yes        | Points (vertices, finite) |

## Add New Graph Types

1. Create a new Python file in `graphs/`, e.g., `MyPolyhedron.py`.
2. Define a function `plot_mypolyhedron` that returns `(fig, description, math_explanation)`.
3. The app will automatically load new graph types at startup!
