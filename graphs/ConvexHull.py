    "Let $X = \\{x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_m\\} \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^n$ be a finite set of points. "
    "The **convex hull** of $X$, denoted $\\mathrm{conv}(X)$, is defined as the intersection of all convex sets containing $X$. "
    "Equivalently, it is the set of all convex combinations of the points in $X$:\n\n"
    "$$ "
    "\\mathrm{conv}(X) = \\left\\{ \\sum_{i=1}^{m} \\lambda_i x_i : "
    "\\lambda_i \\geq 0, \\ \\sum_{i=1}^m \\lambda_i = 1 \\right\\} "
    "$$\n\n"
    "Here, $\\lambda_i$ are non-negative scalars (called **weights**) that sum to 1. "
    "This means every point in the convex hull can be expressed as a weighted average of the original points.\n\n"
    "Geometrically, the convex hull is the smallest convex set that contains $X$. In $\\mathbb{R}^2$ (the plane), "
    "it corresponds to wrapping a rubber band around the outermost points; the band then traces out the convex hull boundary.\n\n"
    "**Property:** The convex hull of $X$ is always convex: For any two points $y, z \\in \\mathrm{conv}(X)$, the line segment between $y$ and $z$ also lies entirely within $\\mathrm{conv}(X)$."

    "**Properties:**\n"
    "- Always convex by construction.\n"
    "- Bounded: Yes (if the input set is finite).\n"
    "- Generators: The input points themselves; convex hull consists of all their convex combinations.\n"
    "- If the input set is finite, the convex hull is a polytope; in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ it's a convex polygon, in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ a convex polyhedron.\n"
    "- The convex hull is idempotent: $\\operatorname{conv}(\\operatorname{conv}(X)) = \\operatorname{conv}(X)$.\n"
    "- Every extreme point (vertex) of the convex hull is an original point from $X$.\n"
    "- By Carath√©odory's theorem, every point in the convex hull can be written as a convex combination of at most $n+1$ points from $X$ (in $\\mathbb{R}^n$).\n"
